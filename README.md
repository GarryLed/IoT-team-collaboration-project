# IoT-team-collaboration-project
This is a group IoT project that uses Arduino software and hardware to solve a real-world problem. For our group project, we are building a hob/stovetop heat sensor safety device designed to alert users if a fire occurs or the stove is left on too long. The device can also warn children and animals from acidifying themselves. 

## Team Report should be posted on your Github account and  include the following:

## Summary of the Project solution  [2 pages] 
Add a summary here (2 pages)

## List of Project Requirements  [outline at least 6 requirements] 

1.	Notify the user via text message that they forgot to turn their stove/hob off 
2.	Warn children/animals if they approach a hot stove top 
3.	Turn off stove if it is on for a certain amount of time
4.	Detects carbon monoxide 
5.	Add more here
6.	Add more here 

Above list may also be modified as it is just there to give us a start. 


## Initial Design – to include sketches of proposed device, proposed code design, proposed hardware setup, description of any APIs or data processing planned
### Sketch: 
* Create a sketch of project 
* Create a sketch of the proposed hardware setup 

### Proposed code design: 
Below is an image of initial code design using the potentiometer, led, and a lcd screen that displays a warning message when tempertaure goes above a certain number: 

**When temperature is withing normal range:**
