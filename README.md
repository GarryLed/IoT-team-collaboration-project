# IoT-team-collaboration-project
This is a group IoT project that uses Arduino software and hardware to solve a real-world problem. For our group project, we are building a hob/stovetop heat sensor safety device designed to alert users if a fire occurs or the stove is left on too long. The device can also warn children and animals from acidifying themselves.
